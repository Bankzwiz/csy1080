    <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
    <p>In this part of my website I will share my experience so far learning Web Development for the 1st time in the first term.</p>
    <p>This is my first time having to learn or do  anything concerning Web Development. At first just like the first time of everything its all new but as got into the main part of it, which was middle of the term thatâ€™s when I started to get grip of Web Development and all the different language which are used as a Web Developer. I have to say that the lecture notes on Nile where very helpful, the tutorial also was very helpful, now I can say after 3 months of getting familiar with the tags and elements in coding I am very knowledgeable than I was during the first 3 week of lectures. Also understanding the difference between HTML and CSS and how they work and how to use them and the different coding language they require for them to function. I would also have to say that our tutor played a massive part with her personality which makes things always helpful for someone like me who was a novice 3 months ago. Finally, it has been a ride worth it, I have learnt, and I can say that its not how far but how well. Am looking forward to the next term
