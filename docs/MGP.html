    <p>The simplicity of this website influenced the design of my site, especially the navigation bar. We where looking for a website which was professional but simple to replicate and ACME DESIGN provided us with that option. Also, another of the site feature which you can find evident of in my own site is the footer section. The footer was something I found interest in mainly because of the simplicity and the layout.</p>

    <p>Along the way as the website began to take form the screen shot of the page above caught my attention, this screenshot is from the ACME DESIGN service page the layout of the information and the way it was structured was something I had to use while designing my comparison and resources page, the line it used to separate the paragraph was eye catching to me and I had to make use of it while designing my own page.</p>
    <p>While designing my inner pages a factor I considered was that I didn’t want to use a layout that was different from each other, I mean it’s good to give your pages different layout which I did, but I made 2 and 2 similar whereby I made 2 of my pages like the other 2 of my pages to maintain consistency. I have to say that Acme Design was very helpful while I started my website, also tutorial on how they came about with their website was also important to me, it was something me and team made it worth the try, and I can say that I am happy with my design</p>
